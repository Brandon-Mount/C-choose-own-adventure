Overview:
For this project, I created a console-based Choose Your Own Adventure game to strengthen my skills in C# and improve how I build programs using clean structure and logic. The game lets the player choose between three different story paths, and each story includes multiple choices that change what happens next.

My purpose for writing this software was to get more comfortable with C# syntax and core programming concepts like user input, decision making, loops, functions, and organizing code using classes and structures. This project also helped me practice debugging and building a program that is easy to expand and improve over time.



Development Environment:
I used Visual Studio to write and run my program. I also used online resources to help me learn how to implement certain parts of the code, understand errors, and improve the structure of my program.
The programming language I used was C#, and I used the built-in libraries:



System:
System.Collections.Generic
System.Runtime.InteropServices
Useful Websites
Microsoft Learn (C# Documentation)
W3Schools C# Tutorial
Stack Overflow
GeeksforGeeks (C# examples)
DotNetPerls (C# references and examples)



Future Work:
Add more story choices and multiple endings for each story
Improve the story system to be easier to expand (ex: load stories from a file)
Add an inventory system or score system for the player
